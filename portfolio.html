						<p>As a designer in the startup space, I'm used to being one-stop shopping for UI, UX, and product marketing. I design for the big picture and see the product in context, whether that means adjusting design strategy to appeal to a prospective customer base, staying careful with content, or doing a deep dive on user research. My background in public policy helps me balance stakeholder needs to create products designed for the long haul.</p>
						<!--<h1 style="text-align:center;"s>Skill Samples</h1>
						<p>Below are examples of user research, wireframing, and prototyping I've done using WhatsApp as a case study. For the case I relied on real user interviews and tools including Figma, Miro, and Typeform.</p>

						<h2><a href="https://elections.erie.gov/Default">Making Voting Accessible</a></h2>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/boe.gif" alt="" /></span>My first job in government tech was product managing a county election commission website. Not only did we overhaul database elements, allowing voters to look up their ballots, register, see their elected officials, and even route to their polling places with Google Maps integration, but the project combined 3 websites from multiple CMS services into one in-house (mobile compatible!) product.</p>
							<p>The project and my skills at the time were pretty exclusively web development based, so this case study was an effort to expand accessibility through design.</p>

A joint project with four students from both the Kennedy School of Government and Chan School of Public Health, we used the "have fun, go make cool data visualizations" prompt to create this PSA about the prevalence of measles in the U.S. and globally. The entire course was a whirlwhind 2 weeks from start to finish and ran scrum-style, serving as both a data visualization and programming bootcamp as well as a crash course in agile.</p>
							<p>The project made use of twitter APIs, datawrapper and python-backed D3 visualizations, and github for version control.</p>

							<h2><a href="https://elections.erie.gov/Default">Making Voting Accessible</a></h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/boe5.png" alt="" /></span>My first job in government tech was product managing a county election commission website. It's a classic case of forgetting to take "before" photos, but the facelift was real!</p> <p>Operating in a local government IT setup meant there wasn't much time to focus on design, but this project taught me tons about woring with complex database integration, cyber security, and what it takes to combine a number of very different websites into a more user-friendly platform. Not only did we overhaul database elements, allowing voters to look up their ballots, register, see their elected officials, and even route to their polling places with Google Maps integration, but the project combined 3 websites from multiple CMS services into one in-house product. We also (finally) bootstrapped the site to be mobile compatible, welcoming it to the 21st century, and secured a grant to translate the material into Spanish for over 30,000 voters in Erie County. </p>
