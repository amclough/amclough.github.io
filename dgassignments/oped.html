						<h1>We Have the Technology to Vote Online (And It’s More Democratic)</h1>

					<p>We used to wind our clocks. We used to get Netflix by mail order. We used to make a lot of things more complex than they needed to be, but the happy ending of human ingenuity is innovation.</p>

					
					<p>Yet for some reason, we still break out sheets of paper and ballpoint pens to vote. </p>
					<p>No one is deluded into thinking current voting technology is the best we can get. The Florida punch card fiasco vis-a-vis Bush v. Gore was the beginning of the wakeup call. That an entire national election could be thrown into such disarray by improperly punched paper ballots should have begun a federal-level review into alternatives to the ballot.</p>
					<p>Instead we gave them a facelift.</p>
					<p>We reformatted, redesigned, and reprinted, but are still too married to historical precedent to reexamine the concept of the paper ballot.</p>
					<p>So why have we abandoned innovation in one of the arenas that needs it most?</p>
					<p>The scope of a national online voting system feels daunting, but the technology is there. We already enable voters to access their registration records online, and the complexity of a streamlined system to perform a single function, casting a vote, is utterly dwarfed by existing federal sites like healthcare.gov. </p>
					<p>It also isn’t an issue of security. Secret ballot proponents have decried for years the use of mail-in ballots, in use and legal under the constitutions in nearly half of all U.S. states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Anyone who has experienced the glories of misrouted Christmas packages and Valentine’s Day cards knows “lost in the mail” is a trope for a reason. </p>
					<p>How is it that the U.S. Postal Service is our standard for election privacy? </p>
					<p>Developing technologies like blockchain, a system that uses cryptography to protect the secrecy and integrity of data, are leagues beyond our mail-in and even in-person ballot systems in terms of privacy.</p>
					<p>If America’s founders were looking for a truly secret ballot, as mandated in the constitution, they would have jumped for joy at the prospect of voting via blockchain.</p>
					<p>Many voter access issues in the U.S. are a self-inflicted product of how complex we make voting. In recent years there has been a push at the state level to increase voter access with measures like early voting, unlimited absentee ballots, and paid leave mandates to allow voters to leave their jobs to vote.</p>
					<p>Yet these measures have made little headway in increasing voter turnout. Why? Because they favor those with the information access to know to vote early, those with predictable enough residency to plan for absentee ballots (the homeless and those in the armed services rarely have this luxury), and those with stable enough jobs to leave for a few hours during the day. </p>
					<p>These reforms are well-intentioned, but designed for the voter who already (nearly) has it all. Online voting would greatly improve access for these voter use cases yet untouched by recent state-level reforms, and would have the additional benefit of appealing to younger generations (the least likely to vote in the first place) who are used to interacting with private and public entities from behind an iPhone screen.</p>
					<p>To be sure, US digital implementations have all but a track record of success. The optics of the healthcare.gov rollout have scarred many federal agencies into avoiding digital implementations wherever possible. </p>
					<p>Federal level technology has a long way to go, but so does the current electoral system.</p>
					<p>The pursuit of perfection in place of the present is a logical fallacy often committed by those opposing innovation. Technological advances are called to improve upon, not entirely perfect, current conditions, and online voting is no exception.</p>
					<p>We should demand better for the integrity of American democracy than limited access, slow reporting, and spurious ballot secrecy. By these metrics, online voting may not be perfect. But by every one of these metrics, it has the potential to greatly improve upon our current state of affairs.</p>
					<p>Dear voter, what say you? Aye or nay?</p>
