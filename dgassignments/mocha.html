						<h1>Medium Black Coffee</h1>
						<p>The user is always right</p>
					</header>
					
					<p>Two years ago I was still doing nights and weekends at Starbucks.</p>
					<p>Starbucks already places a lot of emphasis on user experience, but some of the same discoverability challenges I deal with on tech products were evident back in my barista days. The difference is how baristas and UX designers differ in how they handle users' challenges. When ordering coffee, customers are used to being told they're right. When working with tech products, users are used to apologizing when things go wrong.</p>
					<p>Any Starbucks employee knows the inner eye roll of the "medium black coffee" order. It tends to come from someone who wants to demonstrate that they aren't the hipster Starbucks is used to. They're a real American coffee drinker, one who doesn't need the high-brow comforts of a mocha-frappe-cappa-Venti-chino, and who would probably be crafting their morning Joe out of dirt and cowboy sweat had they not stumbled upon a Starbucks through no intention of their own. Often their order takes the form of a small soapbox dedicated to their value of simplicity and rejection of hipster millennial coffee trends.</p>

					<p>You can probably tell this wasn't my favorite type of customer, but he's right (sorry, it's always a "he.") Starbucks does serve medium black coffees, but just because it's available doesn't mean it's discoverable, and that's a design responsibility. The fact that new customers come out swinging to order what may even be Starbucks' most popular offering is a discoverability problem, and it's not the customer's fault for feeling overwhelmed at a coffee shop menu that doesn't appear to have the world's simplest coffee order on it. The barista then does her job, embracing the role of a translator to input the order.</p>
					<p>In contrast, user research too often goes like this:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>User: "I just wish this product could ____"</li>
						<li>Designer: "It can, our product is great! There's no button for that feature, you just have to hold down Shift + \ + Alt + Ctrl + Spacebar, or a different combination if it's a Mac. It's on page 367 of the print-only manual."</li>
						<li>User: "I'm so bad with technology, why didn't I think of that!"</li>
					</ul>
					<p>As Starbucks employees, we learned to treat the symptoms of poor discoverability, even if we couldn't fix the name of the cup sizes. As designers, we're in a place to actually fix the discoverability of similar problems. We need to use this extra power to act on empathy rather than get defensive or explain what should have been properly communicated through design, especially in roles where our "customers" are self-conscious about their errors, and we know the product too well to see its blind spots.</p>
