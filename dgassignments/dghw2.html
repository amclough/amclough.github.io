					<h2>Hi please don't grade this yet it's a work in progress and super not great</h2>
					<p>Any press is good press, except in government IT.  Save for the Iowa Caucus this past week, no public-sector tech rollout has been so disastrous to make an appearance in late-night comedy shows before or since Healthcare.gov. As the mother of all public failures, its position under the microscope has given us post-mortem insight like no other project, and for this we are grateful. Among many lessons, three stand out as the primary reasons it was so difficult to signal that Healthcare.gov was failing:</p>

					<ol>
										<li>Hope is lethal - Groupthink is not just for 1984. In “The Tipping Point,” Malcolm Gladwell quips that, counterintuitively, planes are less likely to crash with a junior pilot and a senior copilot than the other way around.  Anyone familiar with hierarchical cultures or institutions understands this dynamic, of course, and may not even find it counterintuitive: speaking up is far more difficult when you’re going up the chain of command.  The hope at the upper (read: non-technical) levels of the project silenced dissenting voices, </li>
										<li>IT does not exist in a bubble - Many of the critical junctures at which Healthcare.gov might have been prevented in the private sector were lost opportunities due to the political constraints of the project. Not nearly enough attention was paid to the weight of the project’s success on the broader success of the Affordable Care Act, so while it’s typically easy to hide from politics in a back IT office, Healthcare.gov brought political considerations front and center. The political, not technical, necessity to launch the site by October 1st ruled out the possibility of more than surface-level testing, and was largely ignored as the primary hindrance to project readiness.</li>
										<li> User-centric design matters - Six people successfully enrolled the day Healthcare.gov was launched. The fact that this number was not zero means that the site was successfully designed for some (n=6) users, just not the majority of them. Issues with navigation and general system capacity to handle real user traffic (not just averages from half-assed projected traffic metrics) made it seem as though the server capacity and even the site navigation were prepared for </li>
