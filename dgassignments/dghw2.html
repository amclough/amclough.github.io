					<code>What 3 lessons did you learn about how to identify a failed IT project or signal to leadership that an IT project was failing?</code>
					<p>Any press is good press, except in government IT.  Save for the Iowa Caucus this past week, no public-sector tech rollout has been so disastrous to make an appearance in late-night comedy shows before or since Healthcare.gov. As the mother of all public failures, its position under the microscope has given us post-mortem insight like no other project, and for this we are (perhaps sadistically) grateful. Among many lessons, three stand out as the primary reasons it was so difficult to signal that Healthcare.gov was failing:</p>

					<ol>
										<li>Hope is lethal - Groupthink is not just for 1984. In “The Tipping Point,” Malcolm Gladwell quips that, counterintuitively, planes are less likely to crash with a junior pilot and a senior copilot than the other way around.  Anyone familiar with hierarchical cultures or institutions understands this dynamic, of course, and may not even find it counterintuitive: speaking up is far more difficult when you’re going up the chain of command.  The hope at the upper (read: non-technical) levels of the project silenced dissenting voices, but did so without giving any real direction. The undermanagement of the project meant even with proper technical acumen, IT contractors lacked the instruction to get the project moving in any clear direction. </li>
										<li>IT does not exist in a bubble - Many of the critical junctures at which Healthcare.gov might have been prevented in the private sector were lost opportunities due to the political constraints of the project. Not nearly enough attention was paid to the weight of the project’s success on the broader success of the Affordable Care Act, so while it’s typically easy to hide from politics in a back IT office, Healthcare.gov brought political considerations front and center. The political, not technical, necessity to launch the site by October 1st ruled out the possibility of more than surface-level testing, and was largely ignored as the primary hindrance to project readiness.</li>
										<li>User-centric design matters - Six people successfully enrolled the day Healthcare.gov was launched. The fact that this number was not zero means that the site was successfully designed for some (n=6) users, just not the majority of them. Issues with navigation and general system capacity to handle real user traffic (not just averages from half-assed projected traffic metrics) falsely made it seem as though the server capacity and even the site navigation were prepared.</li>
										
									</ol>
									<code>Do any of these lessons relate to frameworks or theories you have learned in other HKS classes?</code>
									<p>These lessons relate to strategic alignment, a concept we’ve been covering in Policy Design and Delivery. Strategic misalignment occurs when, (among other factors), a goal fails to have all three: value, operational feasibility, and political feasibility. Healthcare.gov failed in each of these categories. </p>
									<p>Strike One - Value: While the question of value of the Affordable Care Act is best left for policy debate, the value of healthcare to those who were hoping to use the marketplace on October 1st is hard to deny. Still, strategic alignment requires that value be aligned respective to those with weight in the process. For many of the contractors on the Healthcare.gov project, this was not the case. Cost-reimbursement contracts in particular removed a lot of the financial incentive, and therefore value, from contractors who otherwise might have had more skin in seeing the project to completion. </p>
									<p>Strike Two - Operational feasibility: Disciples of agile say it was overmanaged, waterfall devotees may cry undermanagement, but virtually every post-mortem agrees that the poor coordination between policy and technical work was the result of a lack of clear management structure. This led to a lack of clear objectives, which wouldn’t have allowed either approach, agile or waterfall, to work. Constantly changing requirements led by policy makers, and not users, along with no clear goals, prevent both the constant feedback loops required by agile and the strict checklist required by waterfall.</p>
									<p>Strike Three - Political Feasibility: Although the operational capacity of the IT squad was compromised from a design standpoint, the political issues facing the project were at the heart of the operational issue. Given just how mission critical and high profile the Healthcare.gov launch was, it’s not difficult to argue that this aspect of strategic alignment was violated. Especially with the government shutdown looming, the fact that the mission scope never adjusted to reality at multiple junctures took what was initially an ambitious project and turned it into a pipe dream. </p>
									<code>Who do you think is responsible for those failures and how, had you been part of the development team, might you have drawn attention to these possible failures?</code>
									<p>Although the GAO, HHS, and Brill post-mortems documented laundry lists of technical issues, Henry Chao is one of the few people who could have strategically aligned the project. The lack of value the contractors saw in their financial incentives, the absence of operational feasibility due to poor management structures, and the hope-ridden blindness behind the broad acceptance to ignore political infeasibility all fall under the purview of the CIO. It was Chao’s responsibility to strategically align these factors for the sake of the finished product. Had I been a part of the development team, I would have tried to address the unrealistic time constraint imposed by the political factors, and pushed for some form of mandatory testing period or incremental rollout of the final product. Had Healthcare.gov even been tested in one state prior to October 1st, things most likely would have been far less of a digital disaster.</p>
