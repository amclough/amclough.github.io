						<h1>The UX Factor</h1>
						<p>The wild west years of product development are over. Once the land has been grabbed, what next?</p>
					</header>

					<p>In true Schoolhouse Rock “Elbow Room” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfoQBTPY7gk">Elbow Room</a>fashion, the U.S. tech industry has made it from sea to shining sea. Until recently, the biggest players were those that could out-innovate enough to landgrab features faster than competitors. In the early years of this proverbial wild west, a fake Zippo lighter was one of the most-downloaded iOS apps, simply because Do you see how the flame moves when you shake the phone?? The name of the game being: develop features as fast as possible, and ask why later or invent a problem for your solution. Within the space of a decade, apps were learning our music taste, paying our bills, and keeping us on track with our 10k training regimens (or trying their best).</p>
					<p>Yet as functionality began to plateau, many of the early movers fell into obscurity. Not because they didn’t have the most innovative features and functionality, but because they failed to realize that in a world with narrowing leaps between feature sets, UX is no longer a “nice to have.”</p>
					<p>It’s the classic Android/iOS conundrum: are iPhone users really all duped into buying pricier phones with fewer features? Well, if consumership were determined solely by hard features, no one would buy an iPhone. As a shameless member of the blue bubble crowd, we’re well aware that we’re often years behind Samsung owners by every old school metric. Our cameras are worse, our phones are strategically obsolete, and if you’d had a baby when Android introduced swipe texting, they’d be an elementary schooler by the time Apple gave its users the same privilege. </p>
					<p>Users will opt out of certain features in favor of cleaner, more intuitive UI/UX, but now we’re learning they’ll also opt in, with some up-and-coming IPOs hedging their bets on exactly that.</p>
					<p>Robinhood offers very little beyond what financial institutions have offered for a hundred years: a way to invest. You could argue the choice to opt out of charging transaction costs was a strategic move in their favor, but it’s safe to say that Charles Schwab could have done the same without making the same waves. Why? Because Robinhood focuses its product development around UX that makes their service accessible as possible.</p>
					<p>Their advertisements explain how buying stock works. Their product lets you customize over time to remove the upfront intimidation factor. Their content strategy is focused around learning and explaining, rather than speaking at a level only wealth advisors can translate.</p>

					<p>Building an app around teaching people to invest didn’t take cutting edge engineering, and didn’t even take a fintech crypto mastermind. For Robinhood, and for an increasing number of digital products, the X factor was just understanding the user.</p>
